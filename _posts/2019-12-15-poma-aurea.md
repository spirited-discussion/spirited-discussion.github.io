Hailing from Spain, this natural apple cider hits you up front with a pleasant olive brine aroma. Coloured yellow-gold, it's got a light bubble and nice tart flavour on  first sip. The tartness hangs around like a sour candy, and some appleiness show up on the back end. It's designated as Brut Nature, which puts it at the driest end of the spectrum, though the fruit notes still give it a sweet character.
