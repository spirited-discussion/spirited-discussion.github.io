description: Reminds me of a CabSav that I used to know
---

After a long day, we cracked open this bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon hailing from Washington state. The first impression: a delicious classic cabernet with vanilla notes has been spritzed into this wine glass and then mediocre wine was poured onto it. I appreciated the tannic structure which left my tongue feeling pleasantly parched but foudn that all the nice fruity notes disappeared almost immediately. 

| *Region*     | Mattawa, Washington               |
| *Producer* |  Charles Smith              |
| *Varietals*  | 97% Cabernet for the 2015 varietal               |
| *Rating*      | Demi â€“ would drink in a pinch but get something else if I needed more than a glass or two               |
| *When*       |  You don't feel like leaving to get a different wine, or it's the most acceptable option you can find at the corner store              |
