Something different – a natural, unfiltered white that hit me in the nose with a taste not unlike boiled leather, but in a good way. Light yellow in colour, with a piney aroma that is  due to the use of mastic, the small evergreen tree use to make the traditional Greek liqueur mastika (highly recommend if sucking on a pine cone sounds fun to you). This retsina is made from hand-harvested grapes and produced with minimal intervention, and the result is something you really can't get from any other bottle. 

| *Region*     | Spata, central Greece (on the coast just east of Athens)          |
| *Producer* |  [Georgas family](http://www.eklektikon.com/portfolio/georgas-family/)            |
| *Varietals*  | Savatiano              |
| *Rating*      | Magnum – I would drink 2 bottles of this before getting fed up              |
| *When*       |  Drink with another simple but brilliant dish like cacio e pepe             |
