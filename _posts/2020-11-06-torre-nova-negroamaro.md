| *Region*     | Puglia, Italy  |
| *Producer* |  Natalino del Prete |
| *Varietals*  | Malbec             |
| *Rating*      |   Two and half dirt clumps            |
| *When*       |   You want to eat licorice but also feel a bit silly.           |

There's something potpourri about it -- rose petals soaking in alcohol. It's aggressive on the nose with some olive and licorice hints punching the inside of your nose. On the other hand there is a sweetness to it towards the end despite the lingering tannins. For the bold!
